			So I decided today, that a simple html page was not good enough. Python is the right language of choice for web development, as everyone knows. I used string formatting and placeholders to create a semi-CMS with json as the data structure. Just a lot of stuff moving around, really.

			I was working on sam the spider- my personal pet (hehe) project of a web crawler. Theres no specific reason to call him sam, just that he needed a name. I reached a stopping point. The question which must be answered is how to parse an html website when there is no standard. They could use list items, tables, raw text anything really- I almost came to thep oint of deciding to run a try-catch and encapsulate every enumeration possible, alerting me if I miss any. Finally the answer came to me crystal clear- its not about the format, its about the text. So, regardless of what the container looks like, I am looking for the meat. Sam is a hungry spider, and a carnavore at that

			After much fiddling around with some css3 and html5 templates I decided that they all are horrible and wrote out the html by hand. Ok, well not by hand by hand, grabbing an example and making it 10 times more awesome as coders usually  do. Discovered that github has a super stellar service called github pages that allows you to host a simple html5, css, and javascript website for completely free. The only catch is that you are not allowed SQL or MySQL connectivity. well for a blog thats not a big deal and if I really need data I'll look into flat files or NoSQL. Still a very cool service and did I mention its free? as in F R double E? beats the heck out of bluehost or godaddy. Much thanks to github for that service. So after some fiddling got the style sheet working and decided to go with a zen, simplistic, barebones site. Who needs glittler? we all know that ninjas hide in the shadows rather than out in the open wearing a grass skirt, holding marraccas and while shouting LOOK at me, I'm fancy! so a zen, simple layout is the method of choice. besides its the content of the blog not the amount of glitter on it, right
